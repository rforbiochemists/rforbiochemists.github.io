# The First Heading
This is a post with executable code.

## Some sub-headings

# Another Major Heading
Some text, lots of text in fact!

# One last heading.
```{r}
r3dmol::m_glimpse("1bna")

prot <- bio3d::read.pdb("4ozs")

Here is a footnote reference,[^1] and another.[^longnote]

[^1]: Here is the footnote.

[^longnote]: Here's one with multiple blocks.

    Subsequent paragraphs are indented to show that they
belong to the previous footnote.

        { some.code }

    The whole paragraph can be indented, or just the first
    line.  In this way, multi-paragraph footnotes work like
    multi-paragraph list items.

This paragraph won't be part of the note, because it
isn't indented.
