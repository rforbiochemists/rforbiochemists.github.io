# What are we doing here?

The idea behind R for biochemists is to enable traditionally wet-lab scientists, who may have previously stayed away from programming, to be able to conduct automated and most importantly *reproducible* analysis of their data.

While there are many great resources available to learn R, a lot of them focus on data and approaches that aren't relevant a biochemist who just wants to automate the analysis of their Bradford assay, or fit a binding curve for their REMSA and calculate a $K_{d}$.

This website will act as a home for a series of blog posts on how to analyse experimental data in R, with a focus on beginner-friendly explanations and code, to make doing *reproducible* and *automated* analysis in R as accessible as possible.
